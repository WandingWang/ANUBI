The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.445 nm between atom 3224 and 4347

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 310 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.041 nm, buffer size 0.041 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.007 nm, buffer size 0.007 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

Reading Coordinates, Velocities and Box size from old trajectory

Will read whole trajectory
