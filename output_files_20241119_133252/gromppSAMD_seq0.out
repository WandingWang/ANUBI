WARNING 1 [file /home/bio/Desktop/jupyter_test/jupyter_test/SAMD.mdp]:
  The Berendsen barostat does not generate any strictly correct ensemble,
  and should not be used for new production simulations (in our opinion).
  We recommend using the C-rescale barostat instead.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

WARNING 2 [file topol.top, line 53]:
  The following macros were defined in the 'define' mdp field with the -D
  prefix, but were not used in the topology:
      POSRES_abiss
  If you haven't made a spelling error, either use the macro you defined,
  or don't define the macro

Simulated tempering is used with multiple T-coupling groups: setting the ensemble temperature to not available

WARNING 3 [file /home/bio/Desktop/jupyter_test/jupyter_test/SAMD.mdp]:
  You are not using center of mass motion removal (mdp option comm-mode),
  numerical rounding errors can lead to build up of kinetic energy of the
  center of mass
